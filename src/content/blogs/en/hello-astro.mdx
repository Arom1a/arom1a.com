After abandoning my last about site, which is bloated with functionalities and ugly in the overall layout, here is a brand new one built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)!

(So sad that I have used much effort on that site \>\_\<.
I'll treat it as the first exploration and practice of Tailwind CSS and a previous iteration of this site...
"Practice makes perfect" after all, right?)

After settling down, this site will become my virtual cottage in the floating quantum sea.
As seen on the nav bar at the left (or on the top of the phone), this site will contain blogs I wrote, photos I shot, and music I covered.
The blogs will be mainly about

- learning notes especially on math & CS
- fun trivia to share
- literature creations
- paragraph-length thoughts
- personal opinions (biased reviews) on everything.

Previous posts may be transferred here soon,
once I have time to polish and format them...

Though parts of the site are still in construction (and they may never been constructed lol), it is refined enough to be published (Some WIP goals can be found in the README, tho).
If you find any elements that can be improved or any advice on this site, please message me or leave an issue or a pull request in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Arom1a/arom1a.com)!!!
